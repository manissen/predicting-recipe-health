# Predicting Recipe Health

By: Mieko Chun and Margot Nissen

## Overview
This DSC 80 project focuses on predicting how healthy a recipe is using features such as nutrition ratings and health tags associated with each recipe.

## Introduction
As health and nutrition become a greater concern, it's important for people to understand the nutritional content of a recipe. This project helps users make better dietary decisions by analyzing recipes through their nutritional ratings and tags.

We used two datasets: **Recipes** and **Interactions**.

### Recipe Dataset (83,782 rows, 12 columns)

| Column        | Description                                                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | Name of the recipe                                                           |
| `id`          | ID of the recipe                                                             |
| `minutes`     | How long it took to make the recipe                                          |
| `submitted`   | When the recipe was added to the website                                     |
| `tags`        | Descriptors about the recipe                                                 |
| `nutrition`   | Nutritional facts: calories, fat, sugar, sodium, protein, sat. fat, carbs    |
| `ingredients` | Ingredients needed for the recipe                                            |

### Interactions Dataset (731,927 rows, 5 columns)

| Column       | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `recipe_id`  | ID of the recipe                                  |
| `date`       | When the user submitted their rating              |
| `rating`     | Rating given by the user                          |
| `review`     | Comment made by the user about the recipe         |

There are more ratings than recipes because some recipes have multiple ratings, and some have none.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning
1. **Merged datasets**:
    
    ```py
    merged_data = recipes.merge(ratings, left_on='id', right_on='recipe_id', how='left')
    merged_data['rating'] = merged_data['rating'].replace(0.0, np.nan)
    ```
    - This kept all recipes, and treated `0.0` ratings as missing.

2. **Handled missing ratings**:
    - Replaced 0.0 ratings with `np.NaN`
    - If all missing ratings were 0.0, the total average rating would be skewed lower than it should be

3. **Created `avg_rating`**:
    - Shows the average rating per recipe.

4. **Converted nutrition strings to floats**:
    - Enabled health score computation.

5. **Created `health_rating` column**:
    - Based on tags categorized into "healthy", "medium healthy", and "unhealthy":

    ```py
    healthy_keywords = {'healthy-2', 'healthy', 'salads', 'chard', 'vegan', 'very-low-carbs', 'vegetarian', 'high-fiber', 'spinach', 'low-carb', 'low-sodium', 'low-calorie', 'vegetables', 'low-fat', 'low-saturated-fat'}
    midhealthy_keywords = {'high-protein', 'pork-sausage', 'smoothies', 'desserts-fruit', 'low-in-something', 'pot-pie', 'dairy-free', 'gluten-free', 'casseroles', 'tex-mex'}
    unhealthy_keywords = {'drop-cookies', 'desserts', 'super-bowl', 'brownies', 'cakes', 'cake-fillings-and-frostings', 'fudge', 'rolled-cookies', 'cookies-and-brownies', 'cupcakes', 'desserts-easy', 'pies-and-tarts', 'sugar-cookies', 'fillings-and-frostings-chocolate', 'chocolate-chip-cookies', 'ice-cream'}
    ```
6. **Computed `health_score` column**:
    - Weighted nutritional values to quantify health:

    | Nutritional Fact         | Impact |
    | ------------------------ | -------|
    | calories (#)             | 0.15   |
    | total fat (PDV)          | 0.15   |
    | sugar (PDV)              | 0.3    |
    | sodium (PDV)             | 0.1    |
    | protein (PDV)            | -0.2   |
    | saturated fat (PDV)      | 0.25   |
    | carbohydrates (PDV)      | 0.1    |

    - Protein gets a negative weight due to its generally positive health impact.

7. **Cretead `health_rating_num` column**:
    - It makes a numerical column representing the health ratings
    ```py
    'unknown': 0,
    'healthy': 1,
    'medium healthy': 2,
    'unhealthy': 3
    ```

7. **Grouped by recipe name**:
    - Prevented duplicate recipe names from skewing the results.

Our final DataFrame has 83,628 rows and 20 columns. Here's a sample row:

| name | id | tags | nutrition| n_ingredients | rating | avg_rating | difficulty | health_rating | health_score |
|------|----|------|----------|---------------|--------|------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| 0 carb 0 cal gummy worms | 45 | [...] | [384.7, 0.0, 0.0, ...]| 3 | 5 | 4.75 | intermediate | unhealthy | 33.5 |

### Univariate Analysis
This histogram shows the distribution of Health Scores with the outliers removed. The lower the health score, the better. This plot helps the users understand the scale of the scores which will be useful when interpreting the rest of the analysis. The mean of the data is **97.712** and and the median health score is **64.999**. The distribution is skewed right histogram, so a higher proportion of recipes are on the healthier end of the scale.

### Bivariate Analysis
This box plot shows the distribution of health scores across four health rating categories: healthy, medium healthy, unhealthy, and unknown, with outliers removed. Overall, we see that recipes labeled as healthy tend to have lower health scores (indicating better health), while unhealthy recipes have higher and more variable scores, suggesting a clear trend in health score as health rating decreases (becomes healthier).

## Assessment of Missingness

In our final dataframe that is grouped by recipe, there are three columns that have a significant number of missing values. These are, 'description', 'rating', and 'review'.

### NMAR Analysis
The 'review' column is NMAR because the missingness of the value is dependent on the fact that the user decided not to leave a review. That is, the reason the review column is blank is because the user decided that they didn't want to leave a review. Its missingness is not dependent on any other column, but rather, the missing value itself.

### MAR Analysis
We moved on to examine the missingness of 'rating' in the merged DataFrame by testing the dependency of its missingness. We are investigating whether the missiness in the 'rating' column depends on the column 'health_score', which is the feature we create to determine each recipe's health by creating a weighted score based on its nutritional values.

#### Health Score and Rating
Null Hypothesis: The missingness of ratings does not depend on the health score of the recipe.

Alternate Hypothesis: The missingness of ratings does depend on the health score of the recipe.

Test Statistic: The absolute difference of mean in the health score of the distribution of the group without missing ratings and the distribution of the group with missing ratings.

Significance Level: 0.05

#### Results
**Observed Difference: 19.6667**
The absolute difference between the average health scores of recipes with missing ratings and recipes with ratings present is about 19.67. This is a pretty big difference, indicating that the two groups differ substantially in their health scores.

**P-value: 0.0000**
The p-value (probability of seeing a difference at least this extreme if the null hypothesis were true) is effectively 0 (or very close to zero). This means it is extremely unlikely that such a large difference in health scores between missing and non-missing ratings would happen by random chance if missingness were truly independent of health score.

**Interpretation:**
Since the p-value is much smaller than your significance level (e.g., 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis and conclude:

The missingness of rating depends on the health_score of the recipe. In other words, whether a recipeâ€™s rating is missing is related to how healthy that recipe is. This suggests Missing At Random (MAR) rather than Missing Completely At Random (MCAR).

### Minutes and Rating
Null Hypothesis: The missingness of ratings does not depend on the minutes the recipe takes.

Alternate Hypothesis: The missingness of ratings does depend on the minutes the recipe takes.

Test Statistic: The absolute difference of mean in the minutes of the distribution of the group without missing ratings and the distribution of the group with missing ratings.

Significance Level: 0.05

#### Results
**Observed Difference: 51.4524**
On average, the time difference between recipes with and without missing ratings is ~51 minutes.

**P-value: 0.1040**
This is the probability of seeing a difference this large (or larger) just by random chance if the null hypothesis were true.

**Interpretation:**
Since p-value (0.1040) > significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. You do not have statistically significant evidence that the missingness in rating depends on minutes. Although there's a noticeable average time difference between recipes with and without ratings, there's not enough statistical evidence to say that recipe duration (minutes) explains why ratings are missing.


## Hypothesis Testing

### Null Hypothesis
There is no difference between the ratings of recipes that have health scores less than or equal to 61.81 and recipes that have health scores greater than 61.81.

### Alternative Hypothesis:
Recipes that have health scores greater than 61.81 get higher ratings than recipes that have health scores less than or equal to 61.81.


### Test Statistic
Difference in Group Means
```py
mean_health_score_by_rating = by_recipe.groupby('health_rating')['health_score'].median()
print(mean_health_score_by_rating)

health_rating
healthy           55.49
medium healthy    61.81
unhealthy         83.49
unknown           67.98
Name: health_score, dtype: float64
```

### Results
**Observed Difference: -0.003661316119038638**


**P-value: 0.213**
