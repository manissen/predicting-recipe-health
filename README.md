# Predicting Recipe Health

By: Mieko Chun and Margot Nissen

## Overview
This DSC 80 project focuses on predicting how healthy a recipe is through a number of features such as the nutrition ratings and the key heath tags associated with each recipe.

## Introduction
As heath and nutrition becomes a greater issue, it is important for people to understand the nutritional content of a recipe. This project aims to help users make better decisions about their diet by investigating the healthiness of recipes based on their nutritioal ratings and health tags.

The two datasets we used were 'Recipes' and 'Interactions'. The 'Recipe' dataframe has 83782 rows and 12 columns. Here are the relevant columns and a brief description:

| Column | Desciption |
| :------ | :--------------------------- |
| 'name' | Name of the recipe |
| 'minutes' | How long it took to make the recipe |
| 'tags' | Different descriptors about the recipe |
| 'nutrition' | Nutritional facts about the rating including calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), and carbohydrates (PDV)|
| 'ingredients' | Ingredients needed for the recipe |
